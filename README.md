# Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://portfolio-khaki-two-90.vercel.app). The site showcases my skills, projects, and professional background as a frontend developer.

## Features

- **Next.js Framework**: Fast, modern React-based site leveraging SSR/SSG for performance.
- **TypeScript Support**: Type-safe components for reliability and maintainability.
- **Custom Design**: Personalized layout and styles using CSS modules.
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly and optimized for different devices.
- **Project Gallery**: Section displaying my key projects, each with description and tech stack.
- **About & Contact**: Easy access to information about me and a way for users to reach out.
- **Fast Deployment & Updates**: Automated with Vercel.

## Directory Structure

- **src/** – Contains custom components, hooks, and logic for the UI and features.
- **public/** – Static assets (images, favicons, etc.).
- **types/** and **declaration.d.ts** – TypeScript types and global declarations.
- **utils/** – Utility functions to support business logic.
- **app/** – Main application and page files (such as `app/page.tsx`).

## Getting Started
